## PHASE 2: Web with HTML generated by servidor and AJAX

### Development direction

- Repository: Github/webapp5
- Development tools: Visual Studio Code, Spring Tool Suite4, Eclipse.
- Dependencies: MySQL Workbench
- To be able to execute the files included in this repository yo should follow the next steps:

2. Start a service MySQL in the local host 3306, we recommend using XAMPP.
3. Start a connection with de database from the ip: 127.0.0.1 in the port: 3306 with the user "root"and without password. We recomend using MySQL Workbench.
4. (RECOMENDED) In Spring, right click over the root project folder > Maven > Update Project
5. Start running the applicattion from Spring by Spring Boot App.
6. Enter from a browser to: https://localhost:8443

## PHASE 3: API REST to the web application and docker deployment
- Document [Api documentation](API.md) with information about the REST API.
### Docker
Docker allows you to use our application without having anything install.You just need to follow the next steps:
  1. Install docker, you can download it [here](https://docs.docker.com/install/#supported-platforms). 
  2. To run the app you simply have to open a terminal in Docker folder and execute "docker-compose up".
  3. If you are in Docker Desktop to access the app you have to open your navigator and go to https://localhost:8443. If you are in Docker Toolbox to acces to the app you have to open your navigator and go to https://localhost: with the port number that it is indicated in the first lines of the command line: for example: `docker is configured to use the default machine with IP 192.168.99.100 `

- To stop the app you have to execute "docker-compose down".
- The docker-compose.yml file uses a mysql image sets up in port 3306 (Don't forget to stop your local mysql), and a contafin image, sets up in port 8080.

#### Linux Commands
To execute docker in linux you should follow the next commands:
- ./create-image.sh
- docker-compose up

### How to run
  1. Run the MySQL database.
  2. Run Spring Boot backend.
  3. On console, go to the root folder of the angular project. 
  4. Run `npm install` to update packages.
  5. Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
  6. Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
  7. To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
